# Data Scientist Salary / Python

Hello

This Data Analysis project thoroughly analyzes in Python the [full dataset of global AI/ML salaries](https://salaries.ai-jobs.net/download/) of ai-jobs.net, which I thank for its readily available and very clear dataset.

Data Mining has been conducted accross all available salary breakdowns, namely:
* company location country,
* domain (Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis),
* job title,
* experience level,
* company size,
* remote ratio,
* employeeâ€™s primary country of residence.

Analysis tools used include
* data density functions and full sets of points,
* summary statistics (median, mean, quartiles, fences, minimum and maximum),
* full hover information about each job position (9 features).
 
Visualization tools include
* interactive violin plots from Plotly Express, with sets of points and full hover information (nine features for each data point),
* other interactive graphs,
* animation sliders and range sliders, which facilitate readability,
* interactive tables, made with the package itables, which convey summary statistics or detailed insights by country, year, job title, and experience level.
